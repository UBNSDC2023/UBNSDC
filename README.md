# University at Buffalo National Student Data Corps (UBNSDC)

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the University at Buffalo branch of the National Student Data Corps (NSDC)! This repository serves as a hub for our projects, resources, and community engagement.

## About NSDC

The National Student Data Corps (NSDC) is a community-developed initiative that provides resources and opportunities for students to learn data science. It was originally launched as the ‘Northeast Student Data Corps’ and has a special focus on engaging underserved institutions, students, and communities.

## Our Chapter at University at Buffalo

The NSDC Institutional Chapter at University at Buffalo (UB) was built to foster and create a great community of future data scientists and analysts in this respected and esteemed institution. We aim to work on guided data science projects, recruit volunteers to teach data science topics, and focus on education and project-based collaboration.
